Proud to share a unique fusion of digital design and cultural art — I successfully generated the "VINAYAKA" symbol through detailed Verilog testbench waveforms. This project challenged me to think beyond pure functionality and embrace creativity in hardware description languages.
Creating such a waveform wasn’t just about driving signals; it was about precision, timing, and visual storytelling using bits and logic. It’s a testament to how engineering knowledge can bring imagination to life in the digital realm.

What I learned:
Crafting meaningful waveform patterns that depict complex images
Managing signal timing and bit-width scaling for clear visualization
Exploring the artistic side of VLSI design, blending culture and technology
I’m excited to keep pushing boundaries in ASIC and FPGA designs, turning ideas into impactful digital creations.
